    <!-- Load Game Scripts -->

    <!--
        It is important to load our game scripts before our game
        Otherwise, our game won't have access to the functions that
        we have defined in our scripts.

        It is also important to load our game scripts in the correct
        order - this is because some classes may inherit from others
    -->
    <script src="js/Vector2.js"></script>
    <script src="js/Rect.js"></script>

    <!-- Load Game -->
    <script src=" js/canvas.js"> </script>
